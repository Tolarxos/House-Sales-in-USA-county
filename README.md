# House-Sales-in-USA- King County
Final mini project which was part of the course "Data Analysis Using Python" from IBM
General Data Analysis of a database that shows sales of houses in King County 
This project mainly shows my approach if I was to handle similar databases.
As a result I haven't included any conculsions, just a few examples to show the code that is needed to do the analysis.
